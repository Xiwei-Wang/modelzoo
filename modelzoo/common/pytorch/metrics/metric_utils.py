    """
    Computes the confusion matrix from predictions and labels.
    The matrix columns represent the prediction labels and the rows represent the
    real labels. The confusion matrix is always a 2-D array of shape `[n, n]`,
    where `n` is the number of valid labels for a given classification task.

    If `num_classes` is `None`, then `num_classes` will be set to one plus the
    maximum value in either predictions or labels. Class labels are expected to
    start at 0. For example, if `num_classes` is 3, then the possible labels
    would be `[0, 1, 2]`.

    If `weights` is not `None`, then each prediction contributes its
    corresponding weight to the total value of the confusion matrix cell.

    For example:
    ```
        confusion_matrix([1, 2, 4], [2, 2, 4]) ==>
            [[0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 1 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 0]
            [0 0 0 0 1]]
    ```
    Note that the possible labels are assumed to be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`,
    resulting in a 5x5 confusion matrix.

    Args:
        labels: `Tensor` of real labels for the classification task.
        predictions: `Tensor` of predictions for a given classification.
        weights: An optional `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`.
        num_classes: The possible number of labels the classification task can
                        have. If this value is not provided, it will be calculated
                        using both predictions and labels array.
        
    
    Returns:
        A `Tensor` with shape `[n, n]` representing the confusion
        matrix, where `n` is the number of possible labels in the classification
        task.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't
            match `predictions`.
